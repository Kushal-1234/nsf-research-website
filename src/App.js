    description: `We are interested in understanding the regulation of phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathways.
     Research is organized around two central questions: 1) which cellular proteins are phosphorylated by a given kinase and 
     2) how are specific kinases and phosphatases—and ultimately the signaling networks of which they are a part—regulated within 
     the cellular environment? To answer these questions, we take a two-pronged approach based on 1) systems-level analysis of 
     kinase-substrate relationships and the biochemical factors underlying kinase substrate selection and 2) the development 
     and application of genetically-targetable FRET-based biosensors.`,
